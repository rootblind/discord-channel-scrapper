# discord-channel-scrapper
Python script to scrape and curate Discord messages from the specified channel. Modifications are done in order for the messages to be stored as a dataset where CLIENT_ID is the bot and everyone else is the user.

# Disclaimer
This script is done in educational purposes, you may get your account SUSPENDED for using this tool so use it at your own risk.

But you should be fine as long as you don't break the rate limit too hard.

# Environment variables

```bash
CLIENT_ID="Your Discord ID"
TOKEN="Your Discord TOKEN"
CHANNEL="Channel ID to be scraped"
```

- I followed [Codium's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh28F6f-Cds) to make the requests and to get the discord token.
